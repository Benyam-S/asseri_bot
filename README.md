* Setting webhook with self-signed SSL certificate
  -  View https://core.telegram.org/bots/webhooks#a-self-signed-certificate to get a better understanding of how to set webhook for HTTPS server with a self-signed certificate. 

* For generating self-certified certificate
  - 'CN=' should always be the IP address of the bot server [0.0.0.0]
  - 'O=' can be the name of the company [asseri]
  - Two files will be generated the certificate [server.pem] and the private key [server.key]
  - Use the below command to generate self-certified certificate if all the above parameters are the same
      # openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -nodes -keyout server.key -x509 -days 365 -out server.pem -subj "/C=NG/ST=Lagos/L=Lagos/O=asseri/CN=0.0.0.0"

* For registering or setting webhook to telegram service
  - IP address used is the ip address of the bot server [0.0.0.0]
  - 'certificate' is the certificate generated by self using open ssl [server.pem]
  - Bot API Token is the api token of the bot [xxxxxxxxxx:XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]
  - Use the below command to set webhook if all the above parameters are the same
      # curl -F "url=https://0.0.0.0" -F "certificate=@server.pem" https://api.telegram.org/xxxxxxxxxx:XXXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/setWebhook
